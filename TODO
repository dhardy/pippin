Extend format to allow "being moved" flag
Make patition division work in the basic case

Test dividing partition 1, quitting, loading and working on partition 2 (unrelated to 1 without knowledge of 1's reclassification), quitting, then reloading all with latest classifier
Test create: note that 'create' test fails because classifier information is now omitted from headers

Classification â€” property of partition, state or both?

How should duplicate elements be handled? Should they be tested for when inserting?
Should there be "search for duplicates" functionality?
Related: assign element identifiers based on hash of contents instead of randomly?

Change partition and element parts of identifier to be 32-bit each

Element identifiers: more useful if user can specify identifiers, e.g. use text
names? How is scaling across partitions possible in this case?

Unique commit-log names? Snapshots only written by some users? This might help with
distributed usage (allowing rsync of directories without overwriting data).

Add Partition::any_tip(). When merging, select closest pair of tips first.

Rename anything partition related.

API: can we remove some things?

Update readme

Do we still need ReadState and WriteState traits?

Check mentions of properties and classifiers / classification.

Completely remove FLAG_RECLASSIFY, HPARTID, HCSF?
What about ext_flags: MetaFlags?

Support opening a partition without loading any data? Probably this is useless
for now; later there may be an option to scan only and read data on demand.

Update doc: remove or update anything specific to partitions
