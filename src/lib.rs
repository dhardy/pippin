// amount of data, verification of data integrity is important and disk writes
// should be minimised. It is designed to scale beyond available memory via
// partitioning and to allow simple backup as well as recovery of as much data
// as possible in the case that some information is lost. It is also designed
// to enable synchronisation of the data set between multiple computers over
// even low-speed network connections, such that all computers have a full
// local copy of the data and its history.

// partitions and how elements are assigned partitions and (d) each partition
// can be managed independently of other partitions.

// Partitions are the *only* method by which the entire set may grow beyond
// available memory, thus smart allocation of elements to partitions will be
