//! Pippin's "repository" type and its dependencies
//! 
//! For simpler, single-partition usage, see the `partition` module. For full
//! functionality, use the `Repo` type in this module.
//! 
//! Implementations of the following traits are required for usage:
//! 
//! *   `RepoIO` with an accompanying `PartitionIO` to describe how to access
//!     the files (or other objects) storing data; the types in the `discover`
//!     module should suffice for normal usage
//! *   `ClassifierT` to classify elements, along with an `ElementT` type
//! *   `RepoT`. This type should handle partitioning, creation of `ClassifierT`
//!     objects, saving and discovering partitioning information, and provide
//!     the `RepoIO` implementation
