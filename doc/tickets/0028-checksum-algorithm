#0028 Checksum algorithm
====

Currently we use SHA-256. Apparently BLAKE2 is faster and offers a similar
level of security.

Should we switch? If so, BLAKE2b would be the obvious choice (we already
optimise for 64-bit CPUs). This lets us choose the output length; what should
we use? To keep code from getting horribly complicated & much slower we want
the length to be fixed at compile-time (and preferably not via a template
parameter, though this is probably possible).
