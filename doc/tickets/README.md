Each file should be named like `NNNN-some-name` where `NNNN` is a four-digit
number uniquely identifying the ticket.

Closed tickets should be moved to the `closed` directory.

Tickets may reference points in the code: the ticket number should be prepended
by `#` and used as a tag, e.g. `#0123`. In this case the tag should appear at
the start of the first line of the ticket file as well as at points of
interest in the code.

The first line should in any case be a short description.
