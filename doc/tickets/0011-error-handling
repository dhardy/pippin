#0011 Error handling
-----------

Rethink which errors should panic, which should result in early return with an
`Err` and which should be worked around with no more than a warning.

Implement a system for classifying errors or start fine-grained handling.

Implement a system for reporting warnings.

Possibly use custom error classes instead of std::io::Error (is there any point)?

See #0017 (warnings).
