#0021 Commit creation
=============

We could redesign `PartitionState` to store a list or map of changes instead of a
parent sum. `clone_child()` would then reset the list of changes.

This would optimise for few changes to a large set of elements (which is the
intended usage); the current optimises more for many changes to a small set of
elements.

We could support both of these via separate types, plus possibly a third type
which does not support modification. There would be a `clone_...` method for
each type and a `Partition` would need to be able to create a commit from each
type which supports modifications.

*   State remembers parent: has to store a `Sum` (currently 32 bytes)
*   State remembers `Vec` of changes: 24 bytes (I think)
*   State remembers `HashMap` of changes: 40 bytes (I think)
