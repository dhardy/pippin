0026 Partition numbers
=============

Currently,

*   `Partition` remembers its number (required)
*   `Repo` uses these numbers in its index (sensible)
*   `PartitionIO` does not know about these numbers, even though they may be in
    the file names
*   Creating a partition requires a `PartitionIO` and a number
*   Loading a partition lets the `Partition` discover the number from the file
    contents (where it probably should be anyway)
*   RepoIO implementations do know about these numbers

This is historical: it was not planned that the numbers would be found in the
file names, and single-partition usage was implemented before multi-partition
functionality. This could still be changed. But should it?

Proposals:

1.  do nothing
2.  make the number available from `PartitionIO` and just verify when loading
