#0017 Warnings: reporting and usage
===========

We need a warning system: certain issues are recoverable but should probably be
reported.

This ticket covers how warnings should be reported, not what should be
reported. Never-the-less, the tag #0017 may be used to indicate things that
should be reported once a reporting system is in place.
