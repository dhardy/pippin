#0010 Corruption detection and handling
========

Aim: given corrupt data (detected via checksums), recover data where possible.

Question: should we be pedantic about looking for corruption?

Question: if corruption is spotted, should we immediately drop to a *read-only*
or *pedantic* mode and not allow many operations until data is repaired?

Should we warn about things we can repair immediately?
