#0016 Pippin file formats
===========

Both formats
----------------

Include time-stamps of writing and/or commit creation in files?

Checksums use up a lot of space in files. Do we need to many? Should we use
smaller sums?


Snapshots
-------------

Store state's parent sum in snapshot (this isn't essential).

Commit logs
--------------------

Do we need the "COMMIT LOG" line?
