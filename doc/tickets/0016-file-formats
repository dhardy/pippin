#0016 Pippin file formats
===========

To finalise:

Include time-stamps of writing and/or commit creation in files?

Do we need the "COMMIT LOG" line?

What should headers contain? Repository name or numeric identifier? Partition
identifier?

Store state's parent sum in snapshot (this isn't essential).

Checksums use up a lot of space in files. Do we need to many? Should we use
smaller sums?
