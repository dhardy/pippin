Store and load without history
----------------------------------------

Data files for snapshots. Library allows reading into memory, mutating, writing
out again.

*   necessary parts of file format done
*   code to load from and save to a snapshot file
*   code to access elements (identity, data) when in memory (read and modify or
    replace)

It also requires some basic setup:

*   some code conventions
*   rudimentary test framework

Done.
