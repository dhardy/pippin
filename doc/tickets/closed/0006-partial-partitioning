Time-based partitioning support
-------------------------------------------

Support snapshots and multiple files. Create new partitions given some criteria
(file size, age).

*   multiple file support
*   partition creation criteria
*   snapshots

----

I think the definition of a *partition* has changed significantly since this
milestone was created. We have multiple files and snapshots already. Closing.
