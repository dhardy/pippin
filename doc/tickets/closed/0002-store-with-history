Simple store with history
--------------------------------

Limits: single file (no partitioning), no synchronisation support. Sets store
simple items, revisions store only the new version (no patches).

*   file format v1
*   simple data items (just plain data)
*   identifier for data items
*   identifiers for commits in change log

Tests:

1.  list contents of a given repository and output some items
2.  appending new items to history and verification of resulting file
3.  creation of an empty repository

Mostly done (slightly different tests)
