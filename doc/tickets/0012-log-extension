#0012 Log extension
--------------------

Log files should be extended much of the time instead of writing new.

Q1: how to design file operations such that extension is possible while:

 *  Existing data is never lost (file corruption)
 *  Multiple simultaneous writes do not conflict
 *  after the write succeeds, the new data can be considered safe

Possibly there should be a global option to verify writes by re-reading for
applications where extra data-security is needed.
